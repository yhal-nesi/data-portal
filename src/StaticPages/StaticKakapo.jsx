      </p><h4>Aim</h4>
      Kākāpō125+ aims to sequence the genomes of all living kākāpō plus some important recently-deceased individuals. The name refers to the total of 125 kākāpō living in 2015 when the project started.
      <br/>
      The overarching aim of the project is to improve genetic management of kākāpō, particularly to address the key issues hampering recovery: infertility and disease.

      <h4>Background</h4>
      The kākāpō is a unique, critically endangered parrot found only in New Zealand. It lives in the wild on predator-free islands. Intensive conservation management has recovered the population from a low of 51 individuals in 1995 to about 150 in 2018.
      <br/>
      Conservation efforts include genetic management using relatedness scores from microsatellite markers. These are used to guide translocations, artificial insemination attempts and prioritisation of individuals.
      <br/>
      Kākāpō125+ was established by Kākāpō Recovery and the Genetic Rescue Foundation following the initial sequencing of a reference kākāpō genome in 2015 at Duke University and Pacific Biosciences. The full chromosome-level assembly of the reference genome (of individual ‘Jane’) was completed and released (external site) on 13 September 2018 (Genbank accession  No. TBC).
      <br/>
      Kākāpō125+ is a collaboration of the following parties: DOC, Genetic Rescue Foundation, Ngāi Tahu, Science Exchange, Experiment.com, Otago University, Duke University, Rockefeller University and Genomics Aotearoa (external site).
      <br/>The project has been funded by a combination of private and public contributions, with all fundraising coordinated by the Genetic Rescue Foundation.

      </p><br/><p><b>Number of files: </b>492 indexed data files + more scripts and analysis files</p><br/><p></p><h4>How to access the data</h4>
      Kākāpō125+ population genome data will be publicly available in late 2018 via application once sequencing and mapping of all genomes is complete.
      <br/>A key principle of Kākāpō125+ is that the data are made publicly available for non-commercial and appropriate use. The data will be shared in adherence to the principles of the Fort Lauderdale and Toronto Agreements for sharing large-scale genetic datasets.
      <br/>The project is a collaborative effort and encourages involvement of all interested parties in analysis of the data, particularly for the benefit of kākāpō conservation.
      <br/>The project is affiliated with the B10K Project and the G10K Vertebrate Genomes Project.<p></p><b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/kakapo-recovery/what-we-do/research-for-the-future/kakapo125-gene-sequencing/request-kakapo125-data/">Apply to use Kākāpō125+ data in your own research.
