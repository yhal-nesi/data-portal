      <h1>Genomics of the New Zealand Trevally (<i>Pseudocaranx georgianus</i>)</h1>
      <p></p>This project will contribute to the development of new aquaculture species, contributing to NZ’s prosperity and the sector’s vision for a $1B industry. Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal production sector worldwide. In NZ a lack of species diversity threatens long-term growth and resilience of the sector. We address this by applying an accelerated breeding approach to the native finfish species Trevally (<i>Pseudocaranx georgianus</i>) that integrates whole-genome information with automated assessment of commercial traits to improve growth, disease resistance and environmental hardiness. This work combines PFR’s experience in seafood production and crop breeding (e.g. kiwifruit) with our recent automated phenotyping innovation and advancements in high-throughput genomics to 1) develop novel breeding tools and best practices, 2) characterise genes underlying commercial traits, and 3) produce aquaculture-ready species. Our approach will lay the groundwork for the commercialisation of additional seafood species and holds tremendous promise for breeding species in less time and money.<p></p><p><b>Number of files: </b>291</p><p><b>Primary investigator: </b><a href="mailto:Maren.wellenreuther@plantandfood.co.nz">Dr Maren Wellenreuther</a></p><p></p><h4>How to access the data</h4><b><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScerXN4MLIAgnLfrHbvheMwtM6gtDNaluZ3c_-xEiot2hc6DA/viewform?usp=pp_url&amp;entry.129341974=Trevally">Apply for access</a></b><br/></div>
